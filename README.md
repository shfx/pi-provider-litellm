# pi-provider-litellm

LiteLLM proxy provider extension for [Pi](https://pi.dev).

Discovers models from a self-hosted LiteLLM proxy and registers them under the `litellm` provider. Supports `/login litellm` and `/litellm-refresh`. Tries `/model/info` first (admin endpoint with rich metadata), falls back to `/v1/models` (OpenAI-compatible) on 401/403/404.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-provider-litellm
```

Pi fetches the package from npm and registers it. Add `-l` to install into project settings (`.pi/settings.json`) instead of global.

To try it without installing (one-off, current run only):

```bash
pi -e npm:pi-provider-litellm
```

<details>
<summary>Alternative: install from source</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/balcsida/pi-provider-litellm.git ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-provider-litellm
cd ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-provider-litellm
npm install
npm run build
```

</details>

## Configure

### Option A — interactive login

Inside pi:

```
/login litellm
```

You'll be prompted for the base URL and API key. Credentials are persisted to `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`.

### Option B — environment variables

```bash
export LITELLM_BASE_URL="https://litellm.your-domain.com"
export LITELLM_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

Stored pi credentials for `litellm` take precedence over `LITELLM_API_KEY`; the environment key is used when no saved credential exists. `LITELLM_BASE_URL` is used when no saved login base URL exists.

## Use

```
/model
```

## Optional environment variables

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `LITELLM_OFFLINE` | unset | If `1`, skip discovery on this start; use cache only |
| `LITELLM_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT_MS` | `5000` | Discovery fetch timeout in ms; `0` to skip discovery |

`LITELLM_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT_MS=0` only disables startup and refresh model discovery. It does not replace the base URL or API key settings required to send requests when you are not using `/login litellm`.

## Mocked LiteLLM smoke workflow

The `LiteLLM Smoke` GitHub Actions workflow starts VidaiMock and a real LiteLLM proxy on the runner. LiteLLM exposes OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic routes whose upstreams are served by VidaiMock, then this extension's smoke runner discovers those models through LiteLLM and sends `/v1/chat/completions` requests through the proxy.

This keeps the LiteLLM integration path under test but does not call real LLM APIs. No provider API keys or GitHub Models permission are required. The workflow also runs a non-interactive Pi CLI smoke with `--list-models` and `-p` so extension loading, model discovery, and a real completion path are covered without opening the TUI.

## Slash commands

- `/litellm-refresh` — force re-fetch the model list, ignoring cache

## Cache

The model list is cached at `~/.pi/agent/litellm-models.json` with a keyed fingerprint of the base URL + API key. Changing either invalidates the cache automatically.

If the cache is older than 24 hours, the extension refreshes it in the background on session start (non-blocking). Failures are silent — the cached models remain in use. Run `/litellm-refresh` to force an immediate refresh.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| "no credentials" warning at startup | Env vars not set and no OAuth credential — run `/login litellm` |
| "discovered no models" | Proxy returned an empty list — check pi's startup log for the actual response |
| `/model/info` returning 401/403/404 | Expected behavior with virtual keys — extension falls back to `/v1/models` |
| Discovery times out | Increase `LITELLM_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT_MS` or set `LITELLM_OFFLINE=1` to fall back on cached models |
